<h1 align="center"> Malay Festive Food Recognition for Calorie Detection </h1>
<p align> This research is for my final year project which focused on the recognition of food images that went through Color Feature Extraction Method after performing segmentation techniques during the pre-
processing phase where each color from the images will be extracted individually.Then the result from the Color Feature Extraction Method is used to identify the type
of food by using Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) classification which is the part of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. </p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9inroHpeSn4">Click here to watch my presentation video :)</a>
